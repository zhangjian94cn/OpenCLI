### Features

* **chess** — add Chess.com browser adapter.
* **geogebra** — add GeoGebra browser adapter suite.
* **jira / confluence** — add Atlassian Jira and Confluence adapter support. ([#1690](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/pull/1690))
* **upwork** — add `search`, `feed`, and `detail` commands.
* **notebooklm** — add guarded write commands.
* **bilibili** — add comment commands.
* **weread** — add book search inside an open WeRead book.
* **linkedin** — consolidate read commands and add `profile-experience`.
* **xiaohongshu** — paginate `creator-notes` past the analyze list cap.

### Bug Fixes

* **extension 1.0.16** — ship the `OpenCLI Browser` / `OpenCLI Adapter` tab-group race fix from [#1693](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/pull/1693). The extension now serializes owned tab-group creation per role so concurrent adapter/browser leases reuse the same group instead of creating duplicate same-title groups.
* **extension 1.0.17** — replace owned tab-group management with a Chrome-state-as-truth convergence model. The extension now keeps one canonical `OpenCLI Browser` / `OpenCLI Adapter` group per profile role, recovers renamed groups from stored hints or owned lease tabs, merges same-window and cross-window duplicates into the canonical group, and normalizes legacy or user-renamed container titles back to the canonical owned-container title. ⚠️ User-renamed `OpenCLI Browser` / `OpenCLI Adapter` groups are now force-renamed back; treat these as extension-managed automation containers, not user free-form bins. ([#1794](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/pull/1794))
* **browser** — write the network response cache file with `0o600` owner-only permissions to keep captured response bodies out of other local users' reach.
* **download** — write the yt-dlp cookie file with `0o600` owner-only permissions.
* **pixiv** — migrate `user/detail` to the shared `pixivFetch` helper.
* **twitter** — drop unknown silent sentinels; read profile `name` / `created_at` from `result.core`; handle `NotAllowed` image-upload fallback; detect private `likes` / `following` empty-timeline shape. ([#1702](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/pull/1702))
* **weread** — decode HTML entities in search results.
* **zhihu** — decode numeric HTML entities in text output. ([#1695](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/pull/1695))
* **xiaohongshu** — hook dashboard fetch to capture signed `datacenter/note/*` responses ([#1732](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/pull/1732)); preserve carousel order via `__INITIAL_STATE__.imageList` on download ([#1687](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/pull/1687)).
* **bilibili** — subtitle support for bangumi / PGC bvid (番剧 / 纪录片 / 电影 / 综艺). ([#1669](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/pull/1669))
* **suno** — derive current plan from subscription metadata.
* **douyin/hashtag** — validate action args before navigation.
* **byte-formatting** — stabilize byte formatting output.

### Docs

* **readme** — correct Node floor (>=20, not 21) and drop the Prerequisites section ([#1705](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/pull/1705)); add CLI Hub brand aliases and split Exit Codes into the dedicated docs page ([#1685](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/pull/1685)); drop the For Developers section ([#1684](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/pull/1684)).

### Internal

* **ci** — disable Dependabot automated updates.
* **test(download)** — retry media-download Windows tests to absorb runner cold-start variance. ([#1708](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/pull/1708))

## [1.8.0](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/compare/v1.7.22...v1.8.0) (2026-05-20)

Substantial release: a new official-API adapter (`weread-official`), wider LinkedIn / Twitter / Reddit / Zhihu coverage, the 12306 / Suno / Xianyu inbox additions, security and reliability fixes for the Browser Bridge and media downloads, plus a 20% README shrink. Node 20 compatibility is restored after an automated `undici` bump regression.

### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* **skills** — remove the `smart-search` skill. Use `opencli-usage` for command/site reference, `opencli-browser` for ad-hoc browser operation, and `opencli-adapter-author` for writing new adapters.

### Features

* **weread-official** — integrate WeRead's official Agent Gateway as the `weread-official` CLI namespace. Pure HTTP, Bearer auth via `WEREAD_API_KEY` (no browser, no cookies). 8 commands cover the official skill bundle: `search`, `shelf`, `book` (info + chapters + progress 3-in-1), `notes` (notebook overview or per-book highlights/thoughts), `review`, `readdata` (weekly/monthly/annually/overall), `discover` (recommend or similar-book), `list-apis`. Adapter surfaces typed errors for all documented failure modes — `AuthRequiredError` on missing/rejected key (errcodes -2010/-2012), `CommandExecutionError` on HTTP/`upgrade_info`/non-zero errcode, `EmptyResultError` on empty payloads. Coexists with the existing cookie-based `weread` adapter.
* **12306** — add full read adapter (`stations` / `trains` / `train` / `price` / `me` / `passengers` / `orders`). ([#1637](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/issues/1637))
* **xianyu** — add `inbox`, `messages`, and `reply` commands. ([#1639](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/issues/1639))
* **suno** — add Suno.com music-generation adapter. ([#1638](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/issues/1638))
* **linkedin** — consolidate messaging and Sales Navigator commands (`connect`, `inbox`, `safe-send`, `salesnav-search`, `salesnav-inbox`, `salesnav-message`, `salesnav-thread`, `sent-invitations`, `thread-snapshot`, `timeline`). ([#1647](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/issues/1647))
* **linkedin/people-search** — add a dedicated people-search command. ([#1649](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/issues/1649))
* **linkedin-learning** — add `search` / `trending` / `course` read commands. ([#1657](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/issues/1657))
* **twitter** — rewrite the download-profile path on GraphQL UserMedia with cursor pagination. ([#1636](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/issues/1636))
* **twitter** — add `list-create` (GraphQL CreateList mutation). ([#1656](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/issues/1656))
* **twitter** — add `device-follow` notification-stream command.
* **twitter** — expose `card.binding_values` on read commands for inline link-preview metadata. ([#1660](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/issues/1660))
* **twitter** — expose `quoted_tweet` on read commands. ([#1667](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/issues/1667))
* **twitter** — expose `bio` on read commands.
* **reddit/subscribed** — new `subscribed` command + listing-level `id` / `created_utc` / `selftext` exposure. ([#1651](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/issues/1651))
* **reddit** — expose `post_hint` / `url` / `preview` / `gallery` media routes on listing commands. ([#1676](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/issues/1676))
* **zhihu** — add answer-comments reader; include answer links in question results.
* **chatgpt** — detect generated image surfaces (CSS background and canvas, not just `<img>`) so image generation works after UI drift. ([#1677](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/issues/1677))
* **external** — add Cloudflare Wrangler as a built-in external CLI passthrough. ([#1679](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/pull/1679))

### Bug Fixes

* **deps** — restore Node 20 runtime compatibility by pinning runtime `undici` back to the 6.x line (an automated dependabot bump to 8.x had moved the engines floor to Node ≥22.19, silently breaking the published Node 20 promise), and clear the docs build audit chain by overriding VitePress' Vite/PostCSS transitive dependencies to patched versions. ([#1673](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/issues/1673))
* **download** — keep custom media filenames inside the requested output directory by stripping POSIX/Windows path components and sanitizing the generated fallback prefix. Prevents remote-controlled fields (e.g. video titles used as filename) from escaping the output directory via `../`. ([#1642](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/pull/1642))
* **browser** — recover `Page.goto()` from stale page identities by clearing the cached targetId and retrying navigation once through the session lease; classify CDP `-32000 Cannot find default execution context` as retryable target navigation. ([#1645](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/issues/1645))
* **cli** — escape leading-dash positional values via the argv preprocessor so users can pass tokens starting with `-` without commander mis-classifying them as flags. ([#1658](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/issues/1658))
* **chatgpt/image** — fix ChatGPT web image generation after UI drift by letting the composer locator continue into the caller's readiness check and detecting generated images rendered as CSS backgrounds or canvases, not just plain `<img>` elements.
* **adapters** — surface the remaining `silent-empty-fallback` adapter failures as typed errors (Douyin user video comments, Jike SSR JSON parse, WeRead search-page fetch). True empty Douyin/Jike/WeRead result sets now throw `EmptyResultError`.
* **adapters** — drop silent-sentinel row fallbacks across Apple Podcasts / Reddit / Gitee. ([#1634](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/issues/1634))
* **adapters** — migrate legal empty-data branches to `EmptyResultError` for `xhs` / YouTube and 5 follow-up commands. ([#1674](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/issues/1674), [#1678](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/issues/1678))
* **lesswrong** — drop the `"Unknown"` silent sentinel in the author column; missing authors now propagate as `null`. ([#1611](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/issues/1611))
* **youtube/transcript** — scope timedtext URL matching to the current `videoId` across the in-page resource-buffer scan, the in-page fetch/XHR hook, and the Node-side CDP capture. SPA-style watch→watch navigation no longer returns a predecessor video's captions. ([#1655](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/issues/1655))
* **twitter/lists** — skip the "Discover new Lists" recommendation block so it is no longer treated as one of the user's lists. ([#1652](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/issues/1652))
* **zhihu** — harden search pagination. ([#1615](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/issues/1615))
* **zhihu** — decode numeric HTML entities in `answer-detail`. ([#1629](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/issues/1629))

### Docs

* **readme** — major shrink and reframing: tagline rephrased around "Browser Use", Highlights and Update sections folded into adjacent content, Built-in Commands curated to 11 popular sites, CLI Hub table reduced to a name enumeration, Desktop App Adapters collapsed to a one-liner, skill-attribution references audited against `SKILL.md` frontmatter, "For AI Agents (Developer Guide)" merged into "Writing a new adapter". Net: EN 410 → 326 (-20%), ZH 455 → 371 (-18%). ([#1654](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/pull/1654), [#1666](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/pull/1666), [#1679](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/pull/1679), [#1681](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/pull/1681))

### Internal

* **audit** — stop flagging sentinel fallback strings inside thrown error messages as `silent-sentinel` violations. These are typed failure diagnostics rather than fake row data, reducing the typed-error baseline to actual adapter output fallbacks.

## [1.7.22](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/compare/v1.7.21...v1.7.22) (2026-05-15)

External CLI ergonomics + two adapter envelope/auth fixes. New `longbridge` external CLI entry; `opencli list` / root help now render human-readable brand labels for executables whose bare name is ambiguous.

### Features

* **external** — add the Longbridge CLI as a built-in external CLI passthrough (`opencli longbridge ...`) for Longbridge OpenAPI market data, account, and trading commands. ([#1584](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/issues/1584))
* **external-cli** — render brand alias `name(package)` in `opencli list` and root help when the bare executable name is ambiguous. Built-in entries `ntn` → `ntn(notion)`, `dws` → `dws(DingTalk Workspace)`, `wecom-cli` → `wecom-cli(企业微信)` now self-explain in help output. `package` field is repurposed to cover both upstream distribution names (e.g. `tg-cli`) and human-readable brand labels (e.g. `notion`, `企业微信`). ([#1585](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/issues/1585))

### Bug Fixes

* **boss** — map `code=24` (identity mismatch) to `AuthRequiredError` so re-login is signaled instead of surfacing as a generic API error. ([#1573](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/issues/1573))
* **weibo** — unwrap Browser Bridge `page.evaluate` envelopes in read adapters. ([#1568](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/issues/1568))

## [1.7.21](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/compare/v1.7.20...v1.7.21) (2026-05-14)

Adapter polish release: new web search adapters, better Browser Bridge tab group reuse, and social adapters returning to one-shot tab leases. Extension package version is bumped to 1.0.15 for the Browser Bridge fix.

### Features

* **search** — add DuckDuckGo, Brave, and Yahoo web search adapters. ([#1546](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/issues/1546))
* **boss** — support job-seeker `chatlist` and `chatmsg` adapters. ([#1539](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/issues/1539))

### Bug Fixes

* **extension** — reuse existing `OpenCLI Adapter` tab groups before creating new ones, including cross-window discovery, legacy `OpenCLI` title fallback, and deterministic candidate selection. ([#1541](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/issues/1541))
* **twitter, reddit** — default browser-backed social adapters back to ephemeral tab leases. Twitter/X and Reddit commands now release their site tab after each run while keeping the shared Adapter window available for reuse; persistent sessions remain reserved for AI/chat-style adapters that need long-lived conversation state. ([#1569](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/issues/1569))
* **xiaohongshu, rednote** — unwrap Browser Bridge `page.evaluate` envelopes in search adapters. ([#1561](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/issues/1561))
* **facebook/feed** — add fallback extraction for empty article nodes. ([#1538](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/issues/1538))

### Internal

* **ci** — add Windows native binding lockfile entries for Rolldown/Rollup optional packages. ([#1563](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/issues/1563))
* **extension** — add regression coverage for the adapter tab group `groupId` tiebreaker. ([#1566](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/issues/1566))

## [1.7.20](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/compare/v1.7.19...v1.7.20) (2026-05-14)

External CLI surface cleanup + Browser Bridge WebSocket lifecycle hardening. Two BREAKING changes around external CLIs: built-in `tg`/`discord`/`wx` (was `tg-cli`/`discord-cli`/`wx-cli`) now match their real binary names, and Notion's in-tree CDP adapter is replaced by the official `ntn` external CLI.

### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* **notion** — remove the in-tree `clis/notion/` CDP-on-Desktop adapter (8 commands: `status` / `search` / `read` / `new` / `write` / `sidebar` / `favorites` / `export`). Notion has shipped an official CLI at <https://ntn.dev>, registered as a first-class external CLI in `external-clis.yaml`. Migration: install `ntn` from <https://ntn.dev> (`curl -fsSL https://ntn.dev | bash`), then use `opencli ntn <command>`. Auto-install is intentionally not configured because the official installer is a shell script while OpenCLI external installs run shell-free command strings. The official CLI uses the public Notion API rather than reverse-engineering the Desktop UI, so it survives Notion app updates and exposes a wider command surface (blocks / databases / properties / comments) than the reverse-engineered adapter could. ([#1559](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/issues/1559))
* **external** — drop the `-cli` suffix from built-in external CLI subcommand names. `opencli tg-cli`, `opencli discord-cli`, `opencli wx-cli` are now `opencli tg`, `opencli discord`, `opencli wx`, matching the real binary names that those tools install as. Root help still shows the package lineage as `tg(tg-cli)` / `discord(discord-cli)` / `wx(wx-cli)`. ([#1544](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/issues/1544))

### Features

* **twitter** — `bookmarks` and `bookmark-folder` now include media via `extractMedia`, reaching parity with `timeline` / `search`. ([#1555](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/issues/1555))
* **twitter/list-tweets** — include media via `extractMedia` (parity with `timeline` / `search`). ([#1464](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/issues/1464))

### Bug Fixes

* **daemon** — report ambiguous browser command outcomes with a distinct `command_result_unknown` errorCode and `503` when the extension WebSocket drops between command dispatch and result delivery. `sendCommandRaw()` treats this code as hard non-retryable, so write-side commands (`navigate` / `click` / `type` / `eval`) won't be silently re-issued and double-executed. Daemon exposes a `commandResultUnknown` counter on `/status` for future observability. ([#1558](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/issues/1558))
* **extension** — keep active daemon WebSocket; stale sockets no longer clobber active connection (`onopen` / `onclose` / `onmessage` are all gated by `ws !== thisWs` short-circuit), and `safeSend` only fires when `readyState === OPEN`. ([#1540](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/issues/1540))
* **extension** — coalesce concurrent daemon WebSocket connects via an in-flight promise. Startup / keepalive / reconnect triggering `connect()` during the daemon-probe or context-lookup async gap no longer creates duplicate real WebSocket connections. ([#1554](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/issues/1554))
* **external** — distinguish external CLI executable names from distribution/project names in root help. Built-in aliases such as `tg`, `discord`, `wx` remain the callable `opencli <name> ...` entrypoints while help renders `tg(tg-cli)`, `discord(discord-cli)`, `wx(wx-cli)` to show their package lineage. ([#1560](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/issues/1560))

### Docs

* **browser** — clarify named session lifecycle in the Browser Bridge guide. ([#1542](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/issues/1542))

## [1.7.19](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/compare/v1.7.18...v1.7.19) (2026-05-14)

Major hotfix + simplification batch. Extension bumped to 1.0.14. Node floor lowered to v20 so the long tail of Node v20–v21.6 users no longer crashes at module load. `opencli browser` user surface replaces required-flag `--session <name>` with a `<session>` positional. `page.evaluate(fn, ...args)` adds a type-safe alternative to the implicit auto-IIFE string form. Twitter cursor pagination no longer silently caps at ~500 items.

### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* **browser** — replace the `--session <name>` flag with a `<session>` positional argument that immediately follows `browser`. `opencli browser work click 12` instead of `opencli browser --session work click 12`; `opencli browser work bind` instead of `opencli browser bind --session work`. Required-flag semantics are now encoded structurally as a positional, matching the Docker/git convention for required operation-target identifiers. The internal `--session` flag is preserved for the daemon protocol and for direct `program.parseAsync` callers but is no longer part of the user-facing surface. ([#1505](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/issues/1505))
* **env** — remove `OPENCLI_KEEP_TAB`. The flag was a debugging shortcut, not a config dimension: `--keep-tab true|false` on the command line is the single source of truth, and adapter `siteSession: 'persistent'` already pins persistent site tabs as a hard constraint. Removing the env eliminates a globally-leaking process state that overrode every browser command in the shell. ([#1509](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/issues/1509))
* **extension** — remove the internal `surface\\0session` command-session backdoor. Browser Bridge commands now route only through structured `session` + `surface` fields; lease-key strings remain an extension-internal registry detail. ([#1510](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/issues/1510))

### Features

* **browser** — add `page.evaluate(fn, ...args)` for type-safe browser-context evaluation with JSON-serialized arguments. String evaluation remains supported, but new adapter code should use function form to avoid implicit `wrapForEval` auto-IIFE magic. ([#1508](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/issues/1508))
* **twitter** — default `tweets` command to the logged-in user when `user` is omitted, and fix the sibling envelope-unwrap silent bug. ([#1531](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/issues/1531))
* **zhihu** — add `answer-detail` to fetch a single answer's full content. ([#1528](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/issues/1528))
* **zhihu** — paginate question answers and recommendations. ([#1517](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/issues/1517))
* **reddit/read** — `--expand-more` via `/api/morechildren` + 7-kind typed errors. ([#1492](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/issues/1492))
* **reddit** — add `whoami`, `home`, `subreddit-info` read commands. ([#1491](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/issues/1491))
* **ctrip** — add `hotel-search` + flight browser-mode commands. ([#1489](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/issues/1489))

### Bug Fixes

* **browser** — `page.evaluate()` / `evaluateInFrame()` now return the user JavaScript value directly. Browser Bridge `exec` previously routed through a shared `pageScopedResult` helper that spread / wrapped the lease's `session` into the result `data`, contaminating arbitrary user returns: array / primitive returns came back as `{ session, data }` envelopes, and plain-object returns had an extra `session` key injected (overwriting any user `session` field). `google search` and `xiaohongshu search` were the visible repro — Chrome rendered results correctly but adapters extracted an empty array. Fixed in extension 1.0.14 by reverting `pageScopedResult` to its pre-1461 form (`{ id, ok, data, page }`); no client-side unwrap is needed. ([#1518](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/issues/1518))
* **twitter** — raise fixed cursor-pagination caps in `bookmarks` / `likes` / `tweets` / `timeline` / `bookmark-folder` / `list-tweets` / `search` / `following`. The old `i < 5` / `i < 10` literals and following's `Math.ceil(limit / 50) + 2` formula imposed hidden result ceilings below `--limit`; the loop now treats the page count as a high runaway guard while `--limit` and cursor exhaustion control normal pagination. ([#1532](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/issues/1532))
* **twitter** — repair `list-add` / `list-tweets` / `lists` / `following` after 2026-05 site changes. ([#1503](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/issues/1503))
* **twitter** — repair `search` and `tweets` readback. ([#1512](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/issues/1512))
* **twitter** — make reply submission robust. ([#1511](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/issues/1511))
* **google/search** — wait for `#rso a h3` before extracting, falling back to the existing fixed wait. On Chrome 148 + Linux Wayland the DOM can settle before SERP anchors are populated, making extraction return empty even with the envelope bug fixed. ([#1518](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/issues/1518))
* **google/search** — wrap evaluate return value in object to fix serialization. ([#1523](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/issues/1523))
* **google-scholar/search** — wrap evaluate return to fix serialization. ([#1525](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/issues/1525))
* **xiaohongshu/search** — extract initially visible cards before scrolling, then merge post-scroll rows by URL. Xiaohongshu's virtualized masonry layout can evict the initial cards from the DOM after scroll, so the previous always-scroll-then-extract flow could lose the top results. ([#1518](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/issues/1518))
* **xiaohongshu** — `parseLikes` handles `2.1w` / `1.5万` / `1.2k` shortforms. ([#1504](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/issues/1504))
* **xiaohongshu+rednote/search** — fall back to href-based note cards when `section.note-item` class is dropped. ([#1507](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/issues/1507))
* **xueqiu** — `kline` / `earnings-date` format dates in Asia/Shanghai instead of UTC. ([#1498](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/issues/1498))
* **download** — clamp progress percentages. ([#1520](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/issues/1520))

### Internal

* **runtime** — lower the Node floor to `>=20.0.0`. Three coupled changes: drop all `util.styleText()` usage (added in Node v21.7.0 / v20.12.0; previously crashed v21.0–v21.6 at module load), downgrade `undici` from `^8.0.2` (engines `>=22.19.0`) to `^6.25.0` (engines `>=18.17`, retains `Agent` / `EnvHttpProxyAgent` / `fetch`), and lower `MIN_SUPPORTED_NODE_MAJOR` from 21 to 20 so the startup guard matches the declared `engines.node`. Smoke-tested on v20.0.0 / v21.2.0 / v22.22.2. The semantic markers (`[OK]` / `[WARN]` / `[FAIL]` / `ℹ` / `⚠` / `✖`) keep their meaning; ANSI colors were redundant for the primarily agent-facing CLI. ([#1524](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/issues/1524))
* **extension 1.0.14** — `pageScopedResult` no longer injects `session` into `data`. The field had no consumers and contaminated `exec` results with arbitrary user-JS shapes; routing-relevant identity is already exposed via `Result.page`. ([#1518](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/issues/1518))
* **extension 1.0.13** — remove the internal command-session lease-key backdoor. ([#1510](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/issues/1510))
* **ci** — drop `e2e-headed` and `adapter-test` from `pull_request` triggers (kept on `push` to main / nightly / `workflow_dispatch`). PR-time CI now targets ~2 min wall-time. ([#1521](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/issues/1521), [#1522](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/issues/1522))
* **scripts** — auto-refresh `dist/` before `build-manifest`. ([#1490](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/issues/1490))

## [1.7.18](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/compare/v1.7.17...v1.7.18) (2026-05-12)

Hotfix release for the 1.7.17 doctor regression: `opencli doctor` failed connectivity probe with `Browser session is required` because the doctor probe didn't pass a session to the new strict-session browser bridge. Also adds new adapters and adapter fixes that were ready immediately after 1.7.17.

### Bug Fixes

* **doctor** — pass an internal `__doctor__` browser session to the live connectivity probe so `opencli doctor` works again under the explicit-session browser model introduced in 1.7.17. ([#1485](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/issues/1485))
* **browser** — `--session <name>` is now declared as a `requiredOption` so Commander itself rejects calls missing the flag before runtime, and the help line is marked `(required)` instead of being hidden under `Options:`. ([#1485](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/issues/1485))
* **doubao/ask** — restore Assistant detection after the 2026-05 DOM refactor. ([#1484](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/issues/1484))
* **youtube** — request `srv3` format for caption URLs. ([#1422](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/issues/1422))

### Features

* **rednote** — add `rednote.com` adapter mirroring xiaohongshu read commands. ([#1475](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/issues/1475))
* **reddit** — add `reply` command for replying to comments. ([#1428](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/issues/1428))

## [1.7.17](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/compare/v1.7.16...v1.7.17) (2026-05-12)

Extension bumped to 1.0.12 (workspace → session lease routing, drop `handleSessions` handler). Major simplification pass: browser/adapter session model rewrite, `--workspace` removed, doctor surface trimmed to its core job.

### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* **browser session model** — replace the browser-facing `--workspace` model with explicit `--session <name>` on `opencli browser *`. Browser commands now require a session name, `browser bind`/`unbind` use `--session`, and bind no longer accepts `--domain`, `--path-prefix`, or `--allow-navigate-bound`. Browser primitives keep their session tab by design; the browser namespace no longer exposes `--keep-tab`. ([#1461](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/issues/1461))
* **adapter site sessions** — replace adapter metadata `browserSession: { reuse: 'site' }` with `siteSession: 'persistent'`, and replace the user override `--reuse <none|site>` / `OPENCLI_BROWSER_REUSE` with `--site-session <ephemeral|persistent>`. Persistent site sessions keep a stable site tab open without idle expiry. ([#1462](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/issues/1462))
* **doctor** — remove `--no-live` and `--sessions` flags from `opencli doctor`. Doctor always runs the live browser connectivity probe (that's its core job); session enumeration was never part of health diagnosis. The underlying `'sessions'` daemon protocol action and the `BrowserSessionInfo` public type are removed as dead code. ([#1470](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/issues/1470))

### Features

* **chatgpt** — `ask` and `send` now accept local image paths and upload them through the composer before submitting the prompt. ([#1476](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/issues/1476))

### Internal

* **extension 1.0.12** — drop `handleSessions` action handler (no remaining consumers after doctor cleanup).
* **extension 1.0.11** — switch Browser Bridge lease routing from user-facing workspaces to explicit browser sessions.

## [1.7.16](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/compare/v1.7.15...v1.7.16) (2026-05-11)

Extension bumped to 1.0.10 (rename adapter-owned tab group `OpenCLI Automation` → `OpenCLI Adapter`). Performance and stability sweep across browser-backed adapters; new external CLI integrations (tg-cli, discord-cli, wx-cli).

### Features

* **openreview** — add `author` command for ID-explicit publication lookup. ([#1365](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/issues/1365))
* **external** — register `tg-cli`, `discord-cli`, and `wx-cli` as external CLI integrations. ([#1458](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/issues/1458))

### Bug Fixes

* **xiaohongshu** — fall back to base64 upload when CDP `DOM.setFileInputFiles` returns `Not allowed` on creator center. ([#1374](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/issues/1374))
* **chatgpt** — switch to locale-stable send button selector so non-English UIs don't break send. ([#1354](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/issues/1354))

### Performance

* **adapters** — hoist cookie reads to `page.getCookies` across Tier 1 (25 files), eliminating per-call CDP round trips. ([#1450](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/issues/1450))
* **twitter** — drop redundant `goto + wait` in adapter steps; framework auto pre-navigates. ([#1451](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/issues/1451))
* **twitter** — enable `browserSession.reuse: 'site'` on 17 read-only adapters so repeated reads share one tab. ([#1454](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/issues/1454))
* **reddit** — opt 13 browser-backed adapters into shared site-tab lease. ([#1455](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/issues/1455))
* **claude** — replace fixed-sleep waits with selector-based readiness on streaming flows. ([#1452](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/issues/1452))
* **deepseek** — replace fixed-sleep waits with selector-based readiness on streaming flows. ([#1449](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/issues/1449))
* **chatgpt** — replace fixed-sleep waits with selector-based readiness (D3). ([#1456](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/issues/1456))

### Refactor

* **browser** — split interactive and automation windows so `opencli browser *` and adapter-driven background commands no longer share one Chrome window; tab groups are isolated by role.

### Internal

* **extension 1.0.10** — rename the adapter-owned Chrome tab group from `OpenCLI Automation` to `OpenCLI Adapter`. ([#1457](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/issues/1457))
* **docs** — list `tg-cli`, `discord-cli`, `wx-cli` in External CLI README sections. ([#1459](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/issues/1459))

## [1.7.15](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/compare/v1.7.14...v1.7.15) (2026-05-10)

Extension bumped to 1.0.9 (Accessibility.enable allowlist + downloads permission + cross-origin frame target attach for AX). Major Browser Agent Runtime release: full Phase 0/1/2 alignment with `vercel-labs/agent-browser` model — CDP-primary input, AX snapshot/refs with stale recovery, semantic locators across all primitives, full form toolbelt (hover/focus/dblclick/check/uncheck/upload/drag/wait-download), annotated screenshots, and same-origin iframe AX routing. Cross-origin OOPIF AX is best-effort (Chrome extension API limitation).

### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* **browser lifecycle** — replace `--focus` / `OPENCLI_WINDOW_FOCUSED` with `--window foreground|background` / `OPENCLI_WINDOW`, and replace `--live` / `OPENCLI_LIVE` with `--keep-tab true|false` / `OPENCLI_KEEP_TAB`. `opencli browser *` defaults to a foreground window and keeps its tab; browser-backed adapter commands default to a background automation window and release their tab unless the adapter uses site-level reuse.

### Features

* **help / browser** — `opencli browser --help -f yaml|json` now emits a structured, agent-ready index of all browser leaf commands (including nested `tab`, `get`, and `dialog` commands), their positionals, command options, namespace options, and root global options. Individual browser commands also support structured help, backed by a shared Commander option/argument spec extractor.
* **help / built-in namespaces** — `opencli daemon|plugin|adapter|profile --help -f yaml|json` now emit the same structured payload as `browser`. One agent call returns every leaf's positionals, options, descriptions, and global options — no per-leaf `--help` follow-ups needed. Original namespace descriptions are preserved through `applyRootSubcommandSummaries()` via a snapshot at namespace declaration time.
* **browser state** — add opt-in AX snapshot refs via `browser state --source ax`, including backend-node click resolution and role/name stale-ref recovery for the Phase 0 browser-agent runtime prototype.
* **browser state** — AX snapshots now include same-origin iframe refs, and `browser state --compare-sources` prints DOM-vs-AX observation metrics for the Phase 1 default-source decision without dumping page contents.
* **browser locators** — `browser find`, `browser click`, and `browser get text|value|attributes` now accept semantic locator flags (`--role`, `--name`, `--label`, `--text`, `--testid`) so agents can act on common controls without a separate state-ref lookup.
* **browser locators** — semantic locator flags now work across input/action primitives (`type`, `fill`, `select`, `hover`, `focus`, `dblclick`, `check`, `uncheck`, `upload`) plus prefixed `--from-*` / `--to-*` locators for `drag`.
* **browser actions** — add `browser hover`, `browser focus`, and `browser dblclick` primitives backed by the same target resolver and CDP input path as `browser click`.
* **browser actions** — add `browser check` and `browser uncheck` primitives that ensure checkbox / radio / aria-checked controls reach the requested state instead of blindly toggling.
* **browser upload** — add `browser upload <target> <file...>` to attach local files to `input[type=file]` targets through CDP `DOM.setFileInputFiles`, with local path validation and file-input verification.
* **browser actions** — add `browser drag <source> <target>` for CDP mouse drag sequences between two resolved element centers.
* **browser wait / extension 1.0.8** — add `browser wait download [pattern]` backed by Chrome's downloads lifecycle API, so agents can wait for file downloads by filename/URL pattern and receive completed/failed download metadata.
* **browser state / extension 1.0.9** — AX snapshots can now route same-origin iframe refs through `frameId`. Cross-origin OOPIF AX routing is best-effort because real Chrome extension smoke tests show `chrome.debugger` may not expose attachable iframe targets to extensions.
* **browser screenshot** — add `browser screenshot --annotate`, which refreshes DOM refs and overlays visible `[N]` labels on the screenshot so visual inspection maps back to `browser click <ref>` targets.

### Bug Fixes

* **browser click** — `browser click` now prefers CDP `Input.dispatchMouseEvent` over DOM `el.click()`, so custom dropdowns that depend on pointer/mouse events (Radix, shadcn, Material UI, Mercury-style category pickers) open and select reliably while retaining JS click as a fallback for older backends or zero-rect targets.
* **browser state / extension 1.0.7** — `browser state --source ax` now enables the CDP Accessibility domain before reading the AX tree, fixing real-Chrome snapshots that previously returned only `RootWebArea` with zero refs.
* **help / build** — every positional arg must now declare a non-empty `help` string. The build-manifest step fails closed when a positional has empty / whitespace-only / missing `help`, so `opencli <site> <cmd> --help` always shows callers what each parameter is for. Pre-existing offenders (`twitter followers/following/list-add/list-remove/list-tweets/search/thread`, `reddit search/subreddit/user/user-comments/user-posts`, `douyin stats/update`, `bilibili subtitle`, `jike search`) now have explicit help text — most notably `twitter followers [user]` and `following [user]` now document that omitting the user fetches the currently logged-in account.

## [1.7.14](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/compare/v1.7.13...v1.7.14) (2026-05-08)

### Features

* **help** — adapter help is now agent-friendly: per-command listings drop the `[options]` noise from globally-shared options (`--format`, `--trace`, `-v`, `-h`, etc.) and only mention them at the site level, so `opencli twitter` etc. read like a flat command index. ([#1401](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/issues/1401))
* **twitter** — write-action symmetry P0: add `unlike`, `retweet`, `unretweet`, and `quote` to round out the read/write coverage. ([#1400](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/issues/1400))

### Bug Fixes

* **browser daemon** — `npm install -g @jackwener/opencli@latest` now correctly auto-restarts a stale ready-state daemon so users pick up the new version without a manual `opencli daemon restart`. ([#1399](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/issues/1399))

## [1.7.13](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/compare/v1.7.12...v1.7.13) (2026-05-07)

Extension bumped to 1.0.6 (screenshot `--width` / `--height` / `--full-page` flags, automation tab group color marker, automation container reuse fix).

### Bug Fixes

* **xiaohongshu** — fix `publish --topics` leaving bare `#` characters with no linked topics. The adapter now types `#keyword` into the body editor to trigger the inline suggestion dropdown and selects the matching topic, matching the current creator-center UI.

### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* **linux-do** — remove deprecated compatibility shims `linux-do hot`, `linux-do category`, `linux-do latest`. Use `linux-do feed --view top --period <period>`, `linux-do feed --category <id-or-name>`, and `linux-do feed --view latest` instead.
* **grok ask** — drop the `--web` flag and the legacy `<textarea>` composer path. The default flow is now the only path and uses the current ProseMirror+TipTap composer (the path that used to require `--web true`). Existing scripts passing `--web` will get an "unknown option" error from commander; remove the flag.
* **env** — rename `OPENCLI_BROWSER_TIMEOUT` to `OPENCLI_BROWSER_IDLE_TIMEOUT`. The variable controls workspace lease idle release time, not per-command runtime; the new name reflects that. Old name was undocumented and removed without a fallback.
* **registry** — remove the unused `Strategy.HEADER`; adapter authors should use `Strategy.COOKIE` and set headers explicitly inside browser-side fetches.

### Features

* **observation** — add trace artifact primitives, `browser console`, `browser network --since/--follow/--failed`, and adapter `--trace=retain-on-failure` for failure-retained browser evidence.
* **autofix** — retire `OPENCLI_DIAGNOSTIC`; adapter repair now uses `--trace retain-on-failure`, trace `summary.md`, and error-envelope trace metadata.
* **browser** — `bind` attaches `bound:*` workspaces to user-owned Chrome tabs without taking over window lifecycle; `sessions` reports `idleMsRemaining: null` for bound workspaces because they do not schedule idle close timers. ([#1169](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/issues/1169), [#929](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/issues/929))
* **browser lifecycle** — owned browser workspaces now lease tabs inside a shared dedicated automation container instead of owning one Chrome window per workspace; lease state is persisted for MV3 service-worker reconciliation and idle cleanup is backed by alarms.
* **browser session** — adapter commands can opt into site-level tab reuse with `browserSession.reuse = 'site'`; Grok and other browser-backed LLM adapters now keep a shared site tab by default, and users can override with `--reuse <none|site>`.
* **chatgpt** — add browser-web baseline commands: `ask`, `send`, `read`, `history`, `detail`, `new`, and `status`.
* **grok** — add browser-web baseline commands: `read`, `history`, `detail`, `new`, `send`, and `status` (existing `ask` and `image` unchanged).
* **yuanbao** — add browser-web baseline commands: `send`, `status`, `read`, `history`, and `detail` (joining the existing `ask` and `new`).
* **qwen** — add `detail` command for opening a specific historical conversation by id.
* **web read** — make page extraction render-aware: same-origin iframe content is merged into the Markdown source, `--wait-for` can wait inside main/iframe documents, `--wait-until networkidle` waits for captured requests to settle, and `--diagnose` reports frames, empty containers, and API-like XHRs for shell/AJAX pages.

### Bug Fixes

* **pipeline / capabilityRouting** — the `fill` pipeline step (introduced in [#1222](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/issues/1222)) now correctly triggers a browser session and gets transient retry coverage; previously a pipeline using only `fill` could crash on a missing page object. ([#1393](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/issues/1393))
* **xiaohongshu publish** — improve image publishing reliability via creator-center URL routing, tab priority handling, and DataTransfer fallback.
* **youtube** — use watch-page HTML for transcript captions to recover when the public transcript API is unavailable.
* **desktop adapters** — restore 11 desktop adapter commands that were lost from the manifest due to a factory-pattern regression.

### Internal

* **cleanup** — remove dead `src/analysis.ts` (179 lines, 0 importers), retire `OPENCLI_DIAGNOSTIC` test residue, derive validator step allowlist from the live pipeline registry to prevent future drift.

* **twitter** — expose `has_media` and `media_urls` columns. ([#1115](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/issues/1115))

### Bug Fixes

* **core** — quality audit fixes: elapsed=0 display, daemon error handler state reset, cause chain truncation guard, download cookie expiry, launcher async kill, verbose error logging. ([#1151](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/issues/1151))
* **daemon** — allow extension ping CORS for reachability probing. ([#1150](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/issues/1150))
* **deepseek** — separate thinking process from response in `--think` mode. ([#1142](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/issues/1142))
* **deepseek** — use position-based model selection instead of text matching. ([#1123](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/issues/1123))
* **weread/book** — add fallback selectors for reader page without cover. ([#1138](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/issues/1138))
* **xiaoyuzhou** — correct podcast-episodes API endpoint. ([#1129](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/issues/1129))
* **bilibili** — resolve full video URLs and preserve full description. ([#1118](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/issues/1118))

* Restore and rewrite `opencli-usage` as orientation skill. ([#1128](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/issues/1128))

## [1.7.6](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/compare/v1.7.5...v1.7.6) (2026-04-21)

Extension bumped to 1.0.2 (body-truncation signal unified across raw / detail / fallback paths).

### Features

* **Window lifecycle flags** — `--live` (or `OPENCLI_LIVE=1`) keeps the automation window open after a command finishes; `--focus` (or `OPENCLI_WINDOW_FOCUSED=1`) brings the window to the foreground. Works on any subcommand. ([#1122](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/issues/1122))
* **Selector-first browser interactions** — `find` / `get` / `click` / `type` / `select` accept CSS selectors in addition to numeric refs; `--nth` disambiguates multiple matches. ([#1112](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/issues/1112))
* **Agent-native browser payload** — structured `network` bodies with truncation signal, `get html --as json` with `--depth` / `--children-max` / `--text-max` budgets, new `browser extract` command for long-form content with resume cursor. ([#1104](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/issues/1104))
* **`network --filter <fields>`** — filter captured requests by body-shape path segments for quick API discovery. ([#1103](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/issues/1103))
* **`get html --as json`** — structured HTML tree output; no more silent truncation on raw `--as html`. ([#1102](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/issues/1102))
* **`browser network` rewrite** — agent-native discovery with cache keys and shape preview. ([#1100](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/issues/1100))
* **Compound form fields** — date / select / file controls surface a `compound` envelope with format, options, `accept`. Cascading stale-ref recovery + bbox 0.99 dedup for tagged elements. ([#1116](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/issues/1116))
* **twitter `tweets`** — fetch a user's recent posts. ([#1098](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/issues/1098))

## [1.7.5](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/compare/v1.7.4...v1.7.5) (2026-04-20)

Extension bumped to 1.0.1 (multi-tab routing + cross-origin iframe).

### Features

* **DeepSeek adapter** — browser-based `ask` / `history` / `new` / `read` / `status` ([#1088](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/issues/1088))
* **Eastmoney adapters** — 13 finance adapters as Phase A oracle: `quote`, `rank`, `kline`, `sectors`, `etf`, `holders`, `money-flow`, `northbound`, `longhu`, `kuaixun`, `convertible`, `index-board`, `announcement` ([#1091](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/issues/1091))

* **Chinese academic & policy adapters** — `baidu-scholar`, `google-scholar`, `wanfang`, `gov-law`, `gov-policy` ([#243](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/issues/243))
* **Download saved path** — `web read` and `weixin download` now show saved file location ([#1042](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/issues/1042))
* **Cross-origin iframe support** — CDP execution context for iframed content ([#1084](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/issues/1084))

### Improvements

* **Multi-tab routing** — hardened target isolation and tab routing ([#1072](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/issues/1072))
* **Skill consolidation** — 6 skills merged into 3 (`opencli-adapter-author`, `opencli-autofix`, `smart-search`); removed mechanical commands `explore` / `synthesize` / `generate` / `cascade` / `record` ([#1094](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/issues/1094))
* **Browser docs rewrite** — docs reoriented for AI Agent use case ([#1080](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/issues/1080))
* **antigravity serve** — configurable timeout + auto-reconnect ([#859](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/issues/859), [#1063](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/issues/1063))

## [1.7.0](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/compare/v1.6.1...v1.7.0) (2026-04-11)

This is a major release with significant internal architecture changes.
Adapter code, validation, and error handling have been modernized.

### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* **Node.js >= 21 required** — `import.meta.dirname` is used in core modules; Node 20 and below will fail at startup.
* **YAML adapters deprecated** — YAML-based `.yaml` adapters are no longer loaded. Existing YAML adapters must be converted to JS via `cli()` API. A deprecation warning is emitted if `.yaml` files are detected.
* **`.ts` adapters no longer loaded at runtime** — The runtime only discovers `.js` files. If you have `.ts` adapters in `~/.opencli/clis/`, compile them to `.js` or rewrite using plain JS. A warning is printed when `.ts` files without a matching `.js` are found.
* **Error output format changed** — All errors are now emitted as a structured YAML envelope to stderr. Scripts parsing stdout for `[{error, help}]` must switch to stderr / exit code. ([#923](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/issues/923))
* **`tabId` replaced by `targetId`** — Cross-layer page identity now uses `targetId`. Extensions and plugins referencing `tabId` must update. ([#899](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/issues/899))
* **`operate` renamed to `browser`** — All `opencli operate` commands are now `opencli browser`. ([#883](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/issues/883))

### Features

* **auto-close adapter windows** — Browser tabs opened by adapters are automatically closed after execution; configurable via `OPENCLI_WINDOW_FOCUSED`. ([#915](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/issues/915))
* **Self-Repair protocol** — Automatic adapter fixing when commands fail. ([#866](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/issues/866))
* **EarlyHint callback** — Cost gating channel for generate pipeline. ([#882](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/issues/882))
* **verified generate pipeline** — Structured contract for AI-driven adapter generation. ([#878](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/issues/878))
* **structured diagnostic output** — AI-driven adapter repair gets structured diagnostics. ([#802](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/issues/802))
* **auto-downgrade to YAML in non-TTY** — Machine-readable output when piped. ([#737](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/issues/737))
* **Browser Use improvements** — Better click/type/state handling for browser automation. ([#707](https://github.com/jackwener/opencli/issues/707))

### Upgrade Guide

1. **Update Node.js** to v21 or later (v22 LTS recommended).
2. **Run `npm install -g @jackwener/opencli@latest`** — the preuninstall hook gracefully stops the old daemon; the first browser command after upgrade auto-restarts it.
3. **If you have custom `.ts` adapters** in `~/.opencli/clis/`, rename or compile them to `.js`. A warning will be printed on startup if stale `.ts` files are detected.
4. **If you have custom `.yaml` adapters**, convert them to JS using the `cli()` API (see `skills/opencli-adapter-author/references/adapter-template.md`).
5. **If you parse error output from stdout**, switch to stderr. Errors are now structured YAML envelopes with typed exit codes.
