## Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `prompt` | Prompt to send for `ask` / `send` |
| `--conv` | Chat id, exact `/chat/<id>` path, or trusted `https://kimi.com/chat/<id>` URL for commands that target a chat |
| `--timeout` | Max seconds for `ask` to wait for a reply |
| `--limit` | Max rows for history, read, detail, or storage listings |
| `--set` | Model name to switch to; exact match is preferred, otherwise only a unique partial match is allowed |
| `--list` | Open the model menu and list model options |
| `--yes` | Required for destructive or account-changing commands such as `history-rename` and `sign-out` |

## Behavior

- Kimi commands use a persistent browser site session and operate on the live `kimi.com` UI.
- Chat ids accept bare ids, exact relative `/chat/<id>` paths, or `https://kimi.com/chat/<id>` / `https://www.kimi.com/chat/<id>` URLs only.
- `send` / `ask` verify that a new user turn containing the prompt appears after clicking Send.
- `ask` waits for an assistant turn to appear and stabilize; timeout is reported as a typed timeout instead of a successful row.
- Model switching rejects ambiguous partial matches before clicking and verifies the selected model by reading the UI back.
- `copy-message --click-button` writes to the local clipboard, so the command is marked as write access.

## Prerequisites

- Chrome is running
- You are already signed into `kimi.com`
- [Browser Bridge extension](/guide/browser-bridge) is installed

## Caveats

- This adapter targets the Kimi web UI and can break when Kimi changes DOM structure, labels, or SVG names.
- Sidebar/history commands only see conversations that the current UI has rendered.
- Cookie output is limited to cookies visible to JavaScript; httpOnly cookies are intentionally not exposed.
