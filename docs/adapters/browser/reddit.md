## Auth-required commands

`whoami`, `home`, `subscribed`, `saved`, `upvoted`, `subscribe`, `upvote`,
`save`, `comment`, and `reply` all require a logged-in `reddit.com` cookie session. When the
session is missing or expired they raise `AuthRequiredError` (exit code 5)
instead of silently returning empty rows.

For `subreddit-info`, missing / banned / private / quarantined subreddits raise
`EmptyResultError` (exit code 6) so the output table never contains a silent
sentinel row.

For `read`, deleted / quarantined / private posts (HTTP 401/403/404 on
`/comments/<id>.json`) also raise `EmptyResultError`. `--expand-more` follows
Reddit's "more comments" stubs by calling `/api/morechildren.json` up to
`--expand-rounds` times (default 2, max 5). If the morechildren endpoint
itself rejects the request with 401/403, that's surfaced as
`AuthRequiredError` because writeable/expand endpoints often require a logged-
in session even though the post listing is public.
