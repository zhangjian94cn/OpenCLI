# Verify a published creator note without deleting it (default dry-run)
opencli xiaohongshu delete-note 6a08ba0b000000000702a893

opencli xiaohongshu delete-note 6a08ba0b000000000702a893 --execute
```

> Note: `note` and `comments` now require a full signed note URL with `xsec_token`. `download` accepts either a signed note URL or an `xhslink` short link. Bare note IDs are no longer reliable on xiaohongshu.
> With `comments --with-replies`, `reply_to` is the direct reply target displayed by the page. Replies without an explicit `回复 <name>` marker target the enclosing top-level comment.
> `ask` is separate from ordinary `search`: it submits the question to 点点, returns `answer`, `source_count`, and `sources[]`, and keeps `xsec_token` in JSON when Xiaohongshu returns one. The current 点点 source API may return bare note IDs without `xsec_token`; in that case `url` falls back to `/explore/<note_id>` and `xsec_token` is an empty string. Each source also carries the engagement and identity metadata 点点 returns: `like_count`, `note_type` (`normal`/`video`), `user_id`, and `published_at` (each omitted when 点点 does not provide it), so citation analysis can read likes and note format without a follow-up `search`/`note` round-trip.
> `delete-note` operates in creator center and accepts a 24-character note ID or exact Xiaohongshu note URL; it defaults to dry-run verification and only deletes with `--execute`.
> `follow` and `unfollow` are write commands on the public profile page. They verify the browser stayed on the requested `/user/profile/<id>` target before clicking, and verify the visible follow-state button after the action.
> `publish --card-text` uses creator-center 文字配图. It requires generated card images to appear in the current composer before filling title/body or submitting. If you request `--card-style`, that exact live page style must be selected; unavailable styles fail instead of silently falling back.
