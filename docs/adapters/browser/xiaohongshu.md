opencli xiaohongshu comments "https://www.xiaohongshu.com/search_result/<id>?xsec_token=..." --with-replies --limit 20

opencli xiaohongshu download "https://xhslink.com/..."

# Verify a published creator note without deleting it (default dry-run)
opencli xiaohongshu delete-note 6a08ba0b000000000702a893

# Actually delete after the target row and delete action are verified
opencli xiaohongshu delete-note 6a08ba0b000000000702a893 --execute
```

> Note: `note` and `comments` now require a full signed note URL with `xsec_token`. `download` accepts either a signed note URL or an `xhslink` short link. Bare note IDs are no longer reliable on xiaohongshu.
> `delete-note` operates in creator center and accepts a 24-character note ID or exact Xiaohongshu note URL; it defaults to dry-run verification and only deletes with `--execute`.
