- `comment` currently requires the page to already expose a fresh top-level comment editor

```

## Search Notes

- Quote queries that contain spaces or shell-special characters, for example `opencli zhihu search "Claude Code vs Codex?"`
- `search --type` supports `all`, `answer`, `article`, and `question`
- `search --limit` supports up to 1000 results, but normal-sized requests are recommended

## Comment Notes

- `answer-comments --limit` counts top-level comments
- `answer-comments --replies-limit` expands up to that many replies per top-level comment
- Comment rows are flattened in Zhihu order. Zhihu's comments API does not expose stable parent comment ids here, so `parent_id` stays empty and `depth` does not claim nested-thread evidence; use `reply_to`, `comment_rank`, and `reply_rank` only as display hints within the flat stream.

## Prerequisites

- Chrome running and **logged into** zhihu.com
- [Browser Bridge extension](/guide/browser-bridge) installed
- A logged-in Zhihu session that can access both `www.zhihu.com` and `zhuanlan.zhihu.com`
