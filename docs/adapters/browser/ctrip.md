## Suggest Columns (`search` / `hotel-suggest`)

Both suggest commands share a uniform column shape:

| Column | Notes |
|--------|-------|
| `rank` | 1-based position in the upstream list |
| `id` | Upstream entity id (round-trips into URL) |
| `type` | Raw type tag (`City` / `Markland` / `Hotel` / `BusinessArea` / `RailwayStation`) |
| `displayType` | Localised label (城市 / 地标 / 酒店 / 商圈 / 火车站) |
| `name` | Localised display name |
| `eName` | English name (may be empty) |
| `cityId`, `cityName`, `provinceName`, `countryName` | Geo context |
| `lat`, `lon` | Best-available coords (gaode → google → flat → null) |
| `score` | First non-zero of `commentScore` / `cStar`; `null` if both unrated |
| `url` | Canonical Ctrip URL or `null` if the entity type has no public web page |

`--limit` accepts integers in `[1, 50]`. Out-of-range values raise
`ArgumentError` (no silent clamp).

## Hotel Listing Columns (`hotel-search`)

| Column | Notes |
|--------|-------|
| `rank` | 1-based position in upstream list |
| `hotelId` | Round-trips into `https://hotels.ctrip.com/hotels/detail/?hotelid=…` |
| `name`, `enName` | Localised + English (English may be `null`) |
| `star` | `1`-`5`, `null` for unrated / 客栈 entries |
| `score`, `scoreLabel` | e.g. `4.8` / `"超棒"`; both `null` if unrated |
| `reviewCount` | Integer parsed from `"13,966条点评"` |
| `cityName`, `district`, `address` | Geo context |
| `lat`, `lon` | WGS84 (1) > GCJ02 (2) > BD09 (3) selection; `null` if all are 0 |
| `price`, `currency` | First room's quote; `null` when no rooms remain at the searched date |
| `url` | Canonical detail URL or `null` if `hotelId` is missing |

Args:
- `<city>` (positional, required) — numeric Ctrip city ID (discover via `ctrip search` / `ctrip hotel-suggest`).
- `--checkin`, `--checkout` (required) — `YYYY-MM-DD`, validated as real calendar dates with `checkin < checkout`.
- `--limit` (1-30, default 10) — Ctrip's SSR first page ships ~13 entries (10 organic + ~3 promoted). Larger limits are not currently supported because the server ignores the URL `pageSize` param.

## Flight Columns (`flight`)

| Column | Notes |
|--------|-------|
| `rank` | 1-based position after filtering incomplete rows |
| `airline`, `flightNo`, `aircraft` | Free-text from the rendered card; `flightNo` and `aircraft` may be `null` (the current `.flight-item` cards often omit the flight number) |
| `departureTime`, `arrivalTime` | `HH:MM` strings |
| `departureAirport`, `arrivalAirport`, `terminal` | Airport names + optional `T1`/`T2` chunk |
| `price`, `currency`, `cabin` | First quoted fare; `cabin` is the Chinese suffix (e.g. `经济舱`) |
| `url` | The search URL (Ctrip's flight cards don't expose per-row stable deeplinks) |

Args:
- `<from>`, `<to>` (positional, required) — 3-letter IATA codes; `BJS`/`SHA` metro codes work alongside single-airport codes like `PEK`/`PVG`.
- `--date` (required) — `YYYY-MM-DD`.
- `--limit` (1-50, default 20).

Rows are extracted from the rendered `.flight-item` cards (Ctrip migrated the
flight list to these; they omit a text flight number, so `flightNo` is often
`null`) because Ctrip's post-load XHR is not currently captured by the daemon
network buffer (see "Caveats" below). Cards with missing departure/arrival/airline
are dropped rather than emitted with sentinel values.

## Round-Trip Flight Columns (`flight-round`)

`flight-round` returns the outbound (去程) leg of a round-trip search with the
same column shape as `flight` (`rank`, `airline`, `flightNo`, `aircraft`,
`departureTime`, `departureAirport`, `arrivalTime`, `arrivalAirport`, `terminal`,
`price`, `currency`, `cabin`, `url`), read from the `.flight-item` cards on the
`round-<from>-<to>` results page.

Args:
- `<from>`, `<to>` (positional, required): 3-letter IATA codes (`BJS`/`SHA` metro codes work alongside single-airport codes like `PEK`/`PVG`).
- `--depart`, `--return` (required): `YYYY-MM-DD`, with `return` on or after `depart`.
- `--limit` (1-50, default 20).

Two differences from the one-way list: `price` is the round-trip total (往返总价)
for the outbound flight shown, and the round-trip cards omit the flight number, so
`flightNo` and `aircraft` are usually `null` (never a sentinel). Picking the return
leg is a second step in Ctrip's flow and is out of scope here.

## Train Columns (`train`)

| Column | Notes |
|--------|-------|
| `rank` | 1-based position after filtering incomplete rows |
| `trainNo` | Train number (`G531` / `D701` / `K528`); the `.checi` icon suffix is stripped |
| `departureTime`, `arrivalTime` | `HH:MM` strings |
| `departureStation`, `arrivalStation` | Station names (e.g. `北京南`, `上海虹桥`) |
| `duration` | Trip length as shown (e.g. `5时56分`); `null` if absent |
| `fromPrice` | Lowest fare shown for the train as a number; `null` if non-numeric |
| `seats` | Seat-class availability joined by ` / ` (e.g. `二等座有票 / 一等座17张 / 商务座(抢)`) |
| `url` | The search URL (train rows share the list page, no per-row deeplink) |

Args:
- `<from>`, `<to>` (positional, required): Chinese station or city names (e.g. `北京` / `上海虹桥`); the list page resolves them the same way the website search box does.
- `--date` (required): `YYYY-MM-DD`.
- `--limit` (1-50, default 20).

Rows come from `.card-white.list-item` cards, read by stable class-keyed
fields (`.from/.mid/.to/.rbox/.surplus-list`) rather than positional innerText.
Cards missing the train number or endpoint times are dropped rather than
emitted with sentinel values.

## Bus Columns (`bus`)

| Column | Notes |
|--------|-------|
| `rank` | 1-based position after filtering incomplete rows |
| `departureTime` | `HH:MM` departure time |
| `fromStation`, `toStation` | Departure and arrival coach stations |
| `duration` | Trip length as shown (e.g. `约2时30分`); `null` if absent |
| `price` | Fare as a number; `null` if non-numeric |
| `status` | Availability text (e.g. `暂停网售`, or a remaining-ticket count) |
| `url` | The results URL (coach rows share the list page, no per-row deeplink) |

Args:
- `<from>`, `<to>` (positional, required): Chinese city names (e.g. `北京` / `天津`); the results page returns the station-level departures between them.
- `--date` (required): `YYYY-MM-DD`.
- `--limit` (1-50, default 20).

The `bus.ctrip.com/` landing is a client-only SPA that does not hydrate under
the browser bridge, so the command navigates the results route directly via its
`?param=<json>` deep link. Coach rows arrive through the `busListV2` XHR and are
read from `.list-item-parent` cards by stable utility-class fields rather than
positional innerText.

## Ferry Columns (`ferry`)

| Column | Notes |
|--------|-------|
| `rank` | 1-based position after filtering incomplete rows |
| `shipName` | Vessel name (e.g. `渤海晶珠`); `null` if absent |
| `departureTime`, `arrivalTime` | `HH:MM` strings |
| `fromPort`, `toPort` | Departure and arrival passenger ports |
| `duration` | Trip length as shown (e.g. `6时30分`); `null` if absent |
| `price` | Lowest fare as a number; `null` if non-numeric |
| `status` | Availability text (e.g. `选择舱位`, `售罄`) |
| `url` | The results URL (sailings share the list page, no per-row deeplink) |

Args:
- `<from>`, `<to>` (positional, required): Chinese city names (e.g. `大连` / `烟台`); the results page returns the port-level sailings between them.
- `--date` (required): `YYYY-MM-DD`.
- `--limit` (1-50, default 20).

Sibling of `bus`: the `ship.ctrip.com/` landing is a client-only SPA that does
not hydrate under the browser bridge, so the command navigates the results route
directly via its `?param=<json>` deep link. Sailings arrive through the
`getShipLineV2` XHR and are read from `.list-item-parent` cards by stable
class-keyed fields rather than positional innerText.

## Cruise Columns (`cruise`)

| Column | Notes |
|--------|-------|
| `rank` | 1-based position after filtering incomplete rows |
| `title` | Line, ship, and itinerary (e.g. `MSC地中海邮轮·荣耀号·上海-那霸(冲绳)-上海·5天4晚`) |
| `star` | Product star rating (`1`-`5`); `null` if unrated |
| `boarding` | Boarding / disembarking note (e.g. `上海登船/离船`) |
| `sailingDate` | Next recommended sailing date; `null` if absent |
| `tags` | Feature tags joined by ` / ` (e.g. `免签 / 岸上游 / 船上餐饮`) |
| `price` | Lowest per-person fare as a number; `null` if non-numeric |
| `url` | The port results URL (cruises share the list page, no per-row deeplink) |

Args:
- `<port>` (positional, required): a departure cruise port name (e.g. `上海` / `威尼斯` / `罗马`), matched against the ports Ctrip lists (`上海` carries most China departures, plus international ports).
- `--limit` (1-50, default 20).

Cruise results live on the legacy `newpackage/search/sN.html` pages keyed by an
opaque per-port code, so the command first loads the 上海 page (which lists every
port as a link) to resolve the requested port name to its code, then loads that
port's results and reads the `.route_info` cards. A listed port with no current
sailings raises `EmptyResultError`. River cruises (三峡) are a separate product
and out of scope.

## Tour Columns (`tour`)

| Column | Notes |
|--------|-------|
| `rank` | 1-based position after filtering incomplete rows |
| `title` | Package title (e.g. `北京5日4晚跟团游`) |
| `subtitle` | Highlights line; `null` if absent |
| `tags` | Feature tags joined by ` / ` (e.g. `0购物 / 成团保障 / 亲子甄选`) |
| `score` | Rating out of 5; `null` if unrated |
| `sold` | Units sold as an integer (from `已售N`); `null` if absent |
| `reviews` | Review count as an integer; `null` if absent |
| `price` | Lowest per-person fare as a number; `null` if non-numeric |
| `url` | The search results URL (packages share the list page, no per-row deeplink) |

Args:
- `<destination>` (positional, required): a destination keyword (e.g. `北京` / `三亚` / `马尔代夫`), passed to the vacations search as `sv`.
- `--limit` (1-50, default 20).

Results render server-side into `.list_product_item` cards; the price / score /
sold fields lazy-load a moment after the titles, so the command waits until every
rendered card carries a price before reading. A destination with no packages
raises `EmptyResultError`.

## Package Columns (`package`)

`package` searches the 自由行 (flight-plus-hotel) tab of the same vacations search
as `tour` and returns the identical column shape (`rank`, `title`, `subtitle`,
`tags`, `score`, `sold`, `reviews`, `price`, `url`); it differs only in the
product section (`freetravel` rather than `whole`).

Args:
- `<destination>` (positional, required): a destination keyword (e.g. `三亚` / `北京` / `曼谷`).
- `--limit` (1-50, default 20).

## Attraction Columns (`attraction`)

| Column | Notes |
|--------|-------|
| `rank` | 1-based position in the rendered list |
| `name` | Attraction name |
| `rating` | Guest rating out of 5; `null` when the card lists only a review count |
| `reviews` | Review count as an integer (`19.7w` / `1.3万` expanded to thousands); `null` if absent |
| `url` | The attraction's `you.ctrip.com/sight/<city>/<id>.html` detail page |

Args:
- `<city>` (positional, required): a numeric Ctrip city id (discover via `ctrip search`; e.g. `1` for 北京, `2` for 上海).
- `--limit` (1-50, default 20).

The `you.ctrip.com` place page routes by the trailing numeric city id (redirecting
any slug to the canonical one) and lists a destination's top-rated attractions as
`/sight/<city>/<id>.html` links carrying the name, rating, and review count. Rows
anchor on those stable links, deduped by sight id, and drop links without a name.
Per-attraction ticket prices sit on each sight's own detail page and are out of
scope here.

## Hotel Detail Columns (`hotel`)

| Column | Notes |
|--------|-------|
| `hotelId` | Echoes the requested id |
| `name`, `enName` | Localised + English (English may be `null`) |
| `star` | `1`-`5`, `null` for unrated / 客栈 entries |
| `score`, `scoreLabel` | Overall rating (e.g. `4.8` / `"超棒"`); both `null` if unrated |
| `reviewCount` | Total review count as an integer |
| `ratingBreakdown` | The four sub-scores joined by ` / ` (e.g. `卫生 4.8 / 设施 4.8 / 环境 4.8 / 服务 4.8`) |
| `facilities` | Hot facilities joined by ` / ` (e.g. `接机服务 / 无线WIFI免费 / 行李寄存`) |
| `checkInOut` | Check-in / check-out policy lines joined by ` / ` |
| `cityName`, `address` | Geo context |
| `lat`, `lon` | Coordinates from the detail page; `null` if absent |
| `url` | Canonical detail URL |

Args:
- `<id>` (positional, required): numeric Ctrip hotel id (discover via `ctrip hotel-suggest`; e.g. `375539`).

The profile is read from `__NEXT_DATA__.props.pageProps.hotelDetailResponse`
(the same SSR source style as `hotel-search`), surfacing the fields the listing
row does not carry. Room-level nightly prices load via a post-SSR XHR and are
out of scope here, the same way `flight`'s post-load price XHR is; `hotel-search`
already reports a representative nightly price per hotel.

## Notes

- Suggest endpoint discriminator: `searchType=D` (search) vs `searchType=H`
  (hotel-suggest). Hotel and BusinessArea rows only appear in the `H` flavour.
- Mainland China suggest rows ship `gdLat`/`gdLon` (gaode). International rows
  ship `gLat`/`gLon` (wgs84). The adapter picks the first non-zero pair.
- Suggest in-band `Result: false` envelopes are surfaced as `COMMAND_EXEC`
  typed errors; HTTP non-2xx becomes `FETCH_ERROR`.

## Caveats (browser-mode commands)

- **Cookie required**: `hotel-search` / `flight` use `Strategy.COOKIE` against
  `hotels.ctrip.com` / `flights.ctrip.com`. If Ctrip serves a captcha redirect
  (suspected bot), an `AuthRequiredError` is raised — complete the captcha in
  your live browser session and retry.
- **No per-flight deeplink**: Ctrip's flight cards funnel every row through a
  shared booking handoff. Until a stable per-flight `bookingId` surfaces, all
  rows share the search URL.
- **Round-trip + airline-filter unsupported**: `flight` is one-way only and
  passes `cabin=Y_S_C_F` (all cabins) in v1. Round-trip + advanced filters
  tracked in the `#1481` follow-up.
- **Hotel SSR page size is server-fixed**: passing `&pageSize=N` is ignored
  upstream — first page returns ~13 rows. Larger result sets would need
  scroll-paginated DOM extraction (not implemented in v1).
